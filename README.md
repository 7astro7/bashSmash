This mini project aims to house useful, short bash scripts. I love bash and came up with the idea while trying to bind rows of a few dataframes that had over 20k observations. It takes a fraction of the time to bind the rows of csvs with the same columns in bash relative to R or Python. Even if it's not too tedious in R or Python, it takes about 1 second with C via bash. Hard to beat that, so I want to share this small but hopefully helpful piece of code.
The first small commit in this repo is simple: a bash script that stacks all the csv files in current working directory and sends it as stdout to a new csv with all the rows bound. The example directory has the active roster of each team in the major NCAAF conferences for 2014. The script asks for the year the data pertain to because that's the common thread between them but this can be tweaked to generate whichever name you'd like the new csv with stacked rows to have. 
The stackData script depends on csvkit, found at https://csvkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. 
This script was written on a Debian machine and has not been tested or adapted to non-Linux operating systems.
